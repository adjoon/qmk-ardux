### remix_layers.h

### remix_shared_defines.h
not exactly sure whats going on here, right now it only defines one line:
```c
#define RIGHT_ANSI_SIX_THREE KC_QUOT,
```

### ðŸ“‚ boards
####    ardux_thepaintbrush.h
currently only defines the same custom layer from the start of remix_layers.h - testing shows that the remix_layers.h takes priority, will try clearing this file for the next build
####    ardux_crkbd_rev1.h
seems to define some basic layout for a larger board - hopefully not relevant to my build? will try deleting at some point

### ðŸ“‚ combos
Contains .def files - these are created with whatever name you want?? so you can organise combos you add by different files?
