### remix_layers.h

### remix_shared_defines.h
Used to redefine IDs that are used in layers to actual keys?
I am also defining #define DISABLE_DEFAULT_NUMBER_COMBOS and DISABLE_DEFAULT_ALPHA_COMBOS and more here instead of later to prevent redeclaration error

### ðŸ“‚ combos
Contains .def files - these are created with whatever name you want?? so you can organise combos you add by different files?
